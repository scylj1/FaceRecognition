# Face Recognition

### Introduction

Deep Learning based Face Recognition (FR) methods have developed rapidly with great achievements, but they usually  require plenty of high-quality data to build the model. When  the dataset is small, classical FR techniques, such as  Eigenface, are preferable. Therefore, we aim to explore the  most representative feature of human faces and the best-matching classifier when there is only one training face for  each face subject in the database. We proposed a Histograms  of Oriented Gradient (HOG) and K Nearest Neighbour  (KNN) combined approach, which is tested to be the most  accurate method in this environment.
